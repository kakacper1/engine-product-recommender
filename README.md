# ðŸ§  Product Recommendation Engine

A data science project that implements two recommendation strategies using Python and Docker.  
The engine uses product ratings data (`ratings.csv`) to provide:

1. **Top-N best-rated products** in a given timeframe (e.g., last year, last month)
2. **User-specific product recommendations** based on similar usersâ€™ preferences

This project can be run as a **Python CLI app** or explored interactively in **Jupyter Notebook**.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Cleans and normalizes input data (`ratings.csv`)
- Supports filtering by date or timeframe
- User-based collaborative filtering (cosine similarity)
- Easily extendable for model-based recommendations
- Ready-to-run with Docker or directly with Python
